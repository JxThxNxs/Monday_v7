This is Monday, its my Python Voice Assistant.
How to use it? 

You have to set all directorys to the directory 
of other python files if you have some,
so you could use the "open on command" feature.

If you can't understand or speak german,
you have to change all commmands and the language
in the Voice settings. 
(in the full realease english will be included)
Have Fun!
